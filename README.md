# Ocean Acidification
Ocean acidification affects the distribution and productivity of marine ecosystems and impacts fisheries and coastal communities. High dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations are an indicator of ocean acidification, where an increase in the concentration of DIC is associated with a decrease in ocean pH. This script uses [Bottle Database](https://calcofi.org/data/oceanographic-data/bottle-database/) data to determine what hydrographic parameters best predict DIC concentrations. The Bottle Database contains oceanographic data measured from seawater samples collected at California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) stations from 1949 to present.
